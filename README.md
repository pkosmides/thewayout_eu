# thewayout_eu
The application The Way Out is an android application that was initially developed for the ehackthecrisiscyprus event but was further enhanced for the #euvsvirus organized by the European Commission (https://euvsvirus.org/) in order to #hackthecrisis.

The concept is to provide a mobile application that will provide useful information and assistance to citizens about COVID-19. Specifically: 
- citizens will be able to be informed about the exact locations where they can find help for issues regarding COVI-19 (like financial assistance, health assistance, etc.). 
- fight #disinformation and #fakenews: the application will provide official news for the evolution of COVID-19 
- Smart Assistant: provide advice to citizens
- Volunteering:  support groups of people who want to help fellow citizens in need.
